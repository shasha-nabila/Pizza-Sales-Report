# Pizza Sales Report

## Pizza Sales Data Analysis KPIs

We are analyzing key indicators to gain insights into our business performance with respect to pizza sales. The specific metrics we aim to calculate are:

1. **Total Revenue**: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value**: The average amount spent per order, which is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

These KPIs will help us understand customer purchasing patterns, menu item performance, and overall sales trends.
