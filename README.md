# Pizza Sales Report

### Business Task
Analyzing pizza sales data to understand business performance and customer preferences. This includes calculating key performance indicators like total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold. Additionally, it requires creating various charts like bar, line, and pie charts to visualize sales trends, such as hourly and weekly sales patterns, and the popularity of different pizza categories and sizes. The goal is to use these insights for improving business strategies and menu offerings.
