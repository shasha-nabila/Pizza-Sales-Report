## Problem Statement
### Pizza Sales Data Analysis KPIs

We are analyzing key indicators to gain insights into our business performance with respect to pizza sales. The specific metrics we aim to calculate are:

1. **Total Revenue**: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value**: The average amount spent per order, which is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

These KPIs will help us understand customer purchasing patterns, menu item performance, and overall sales trends.

### Chart Requirements for Pizza Sales Data Visualization

To better visualize our pizza sales data and understand key trends, we've outlined specific requirements for creating charts:

1. **Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold**: A stacked bar chart displaying the hourly trend of total orders over a specific time period to identify patterns or fluctuations in order volumes hourly.

2. **Weekly Trend for Total Orders**: A line chart that illustrates the weekly trend of total orders throughout the year to pinpoint peak weeks or periods of high order activity.

3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: A pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories to gain insights into the popularity and contribution to overall sales.

4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: A pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes, helping us understand customer preferences and their impact on sales.

5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**: A funnel chart presenting the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category to assess the sales performance of different pizza categories.

6. **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders**: A bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders to identify the most popular pizza options.

7. **Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders**: A bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders to identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.

These visualizations will help us make data-driven decisions to enhance our business strategy and menu offerings.
